# bookbot

Bookbot is my first python project. It is a tool designed to analyze text input and generate a detailed report on the occurrences of alphabetic characters

## Getting Started

Follow these steps to begin using BookBot:

1. Clone the repository:

   ```
   git clone <url>
   ```

2. Add a text file (either with a `.txt` extension or in a regular text format) to the root folder of the project.

3. Copy some text into the file to be analyzed.

4. In the `main.py` file, modify the `book_path` variable to point to the location of your text file.

5. Open a terminal and navigate to the project directory. Run the following command to execute BookBot:
   ```
   python main.py
   ```
   or
   ```
   python3 main.py
   ```
